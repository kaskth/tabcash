# Child API

This service allows you to create a sub-account for your children under the age of 16, where you can add money to their sub-account via your smart wallet. You can specify the frequency of these deposits every day, week or month, depending on your desire and requirements.

Through the sub-account, your children can access the sums of money that you put in their account, and they can use it through the smart wallet and transfer it to their cash balance to use it to buy the things they want.

The system also allows you to determine the extent of control that you have over the disbursement of the sums of money deposited in the childâ€™s sub-account, where you can set the maximum daily, weekly or monthly expenditure, and you can also define the categories in which your children can use the sums of money, such as food commodities, clothes or toys or recreational activities.
